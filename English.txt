Note:

On some ATI Cards it might be possible that there's no mouse 
pointer in the main menu, or that the screen goes black at the 
start of the game.
This is caused due to old/incompatible Drivers from ATI Tech.
The problem can be solved by clicking start --> Run and then 
typing dxdiag and clicking ok, now the Direct X Diagnostic 
program will start, in this program select the "Display" or 
"Display 1" Tab, on that tab disable the DirectDraw acceleration.

Make sure to Enable Directdraw again when finished playing the game.
